I plan to keep a list of the books I have read since past year.

### 2019

I have not finished any book yet, but I am reading the following:

- [The Black Swan - Nassim Nicholas Taleb](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/242472.The_Black_Swan).

### 2018

Unfortunately this list is not as long as I thought it would be.

- [Sapiens - Yuval Noah Hariri.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens) I read this Book, just like everyone else. But unlike most people, I found it kind of hard to get through.
- [Moneyball - Michael Lewis.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1301.Moneyball) I like the books by Michael Lewis, I have read two books by him this year.
- [Born a Crime - Trevor Noah.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29780253-born-a-crime)
- [Liar's Poker - Michael Lewis.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7865083-liar-s-poker)
- [The Sellout - Paul Beatty.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22237161-the-sellout)
- [Against the Gods - Peter Bernstein.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/128429.Against_the_Gods)
