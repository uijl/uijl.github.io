My name is Joris den Uijl. I graduated as a [hydraulic engineer from TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ceg/about-faculty/departments/hydraulic-engineering/) in January '18. During my study I got more and more interested in "tech". I started reading Hacker News, following ProductHunt and tought myself python programming. Luckily I was able to join a [large marine contractor](https://www.vanoord.com/ "Van Oord") as a Data Engineer.

I like data science/analytics/visualisation and python so most of my _projects_ will comprise either analysing data or obtaining data. I'll post all code as python notebooks on [GitHub](https://github.com/uijl/uijl.github.io_code "GitHub of Joris").

If you wish to contact feel free to send me a message on [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/jorisdenuijl "Twitter of Joris") or connect with me on [LinkedIn]("LinkedIn of Joris").
