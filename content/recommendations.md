I like to keep a list of useful resources on the web.

### Who to follow

I am no other social media platform than twitter, this is my main source of news (I am still in doubt whether to block the word "Trump") and I keep up-to-date with tech related news. On twitter I highly recommend following:

- [Ryan Hoover](https://twitter.com/rrhoover), the founder of [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/) and therefore ahead of everyone else when it comes to new start-ups, products or trends.
- [Owen Williams](https://www.twitter.com/ow), a tech journalist who writes for his own blog and newsletter [Charged](https://char.gd/).
- [Naval Ravikant](https://twitter.com/naval), founder of [AngelList](https://angel.co/) and [investor](https://angel.co/naval). He uses twitter to broadcast his knowledge.
- [Elon Musk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk), I'll admit that I am a fanboy. I did not like the "pedo guy-tweet" and even deleted twitter because of it. But I came back after a few weeks and Elon was the first guy a followed again.

### Websites

The websites that I literelly visit everyday is limited to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) and [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/).

- [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com). Hacker news is a forum hosted by Y-Combinator, a venture capital firm from Silicon Valley. The forum is used to share and discuss articles and to ask for help. I enjoy the "Ask HN" threats because members of the forum have valuable insights into various industries.
- [ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com). A website to *hunt* new products or new product-releases. I do not visit daily, but I am subscribed to the daily newsletter to keep up with the most popular new products.
- [Fermat's Library](https://fermatslibrary.com/journal_club). One scientific paper per week, with the ability to annotate and discuss with other people. The most popular one, is the paper by [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://fermatslibrary.com/s/bitcoin "Paper on Bitcoin").

### Podcasts

I like listening to podcasts: both the non-fiction storytype and interviews. Of the list below I listen to every episode of the Pivot and the Indie Hackers podcast. Unfortunately the podcast series on ISIS (Caliphate) has ended but I still recommend it. I don't listen to all Joe Rogan episodes, but I loved the one with Elon Musk. 

- [Pivot](https://art19.com/shows/pivot-with-kara-swisher-and-scott-galloway). Interesting converstations between [Kara Swisher](https://twitter.com/karaswisher) and [Scott Galloway](https://twitter.com/profgalloway) on tech and business.
- [The Indie Hackers Podcast](https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast). This is the podcast by the website "Indie Hackers": A forum on which creators of business come together to as for, and share, advise. The founder of the website, Courtland Allen, interviews a wide variety of guests with one common theme: how to start or run a business without investment.
- [Caliphate](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/podcasts/caliphate-isis-rukmini-callimachi.html). There won't be any new episodes but this is one of the best podcasts I ever listened to. It is made by two journalists of the New York Times that even travelled to Syria for their research.
- [Joe Rogan with Elon Musk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycPr5-27vSI). Again, Elon Musk. I am not subscribed to the podcast by Joe Rogan, but sometimes he has interesting guests. Like this time, and although it was very controversial (for Wall street ..) because Elon Musk was sipping whiskey and smoking weed, the interview is very interesting.

### Courses

It is the best time to be alive for people with a wide interest like me because the internet is flooded with courses. There are wonderfull courses on YouTube, Coursera, Khan Academy and so on. Below is a list of the courses I enjoyed taking:

- [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning "Machine learning by Andrew NG"). Introduction into linear algebra and vectorized programming for basic Neural Networks.
- [3B1B](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw "Three blue one brown"). A wide range of interesting topics, explained very good and with good visuals.
- [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/ "30 introduction lessons into JavaScript"). Introduction courses into JavaScript.
