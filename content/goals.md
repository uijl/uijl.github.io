Since I am trained as a (hydraulic) engineering I learned to code by myself. To prioritize my time I need a clear list of (prioritized) goals. The goal of publishing this list is similar as this website: Forcing myself to showcase my results and goals. If you have any questions or recommendations, please contact me on [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/jorisdenuijl).

This will be a "living" document and I'll update is as I came across something else or finished one of the listed goals.

### 1. Python

I trained myself Python with the goal of analysing and visualising data, therefore my skills are limited to Matplotlib, Scipy, Numpy and Pandas. Because I had to obtain data I have learned a thing or two about Requests and Beautiful Soup as well.

I don't think I'll ever be a *"true"* developer, but I want to learn more on python. Because my coding is self-thought it often lacks commenting, I can do a lot more of vectorisation and maybe lack the specific python knowledge on functions that I can do (or should do) without the use of libraries.

That is why I made this blog, by sharing my code I enforce my self to comment my code correctly for others to understand. I also hope that people will advise or correct me. I do not (yet) have a specific course I can follow to improve my code.

### 2. D3.js

The only webdevelopment experience that I have is in building a webstore using woocommerce and building static websites similar to this blog. That required limited knowledge on HTML, CSS and javascript. For future projects however, I plan to use the D3.js framework for visualisation. Without any understanding on javascript or visualisation on the web it is very hard to get started. Therefore is my first goal to understand javascript and the second goal to get a feeling for webvisualisation.

I selected two courses to get me started:

- [JavaScript 30](https://www.javascript30.com/);
- [Fundamentals of web visualisation](http://www.alignedleft.com/tutorials/d3).

### 3. Mathematics behind Machine Learning algorithms

It is very frustrating to gain valuable insights on Machine Learning due to all the bullshit that is available online. I once started a course on [Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud120) but quit halfway through after realising it was more or less a showcase on using [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html). Of course, being able to use a powerfull library such as SKLearn is very valuable, but I think that understanding the mathematics underlying these algorithms (even only the basics) is required to actually draw conclusions from your output.

I really enjoyed the course by [Andrew Ng on Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.com). It is focussed (to a certain extend) on the mathematics behind Neural Networks especially, which I found very interesting and was exactly what I was looking for. I even paid for the certificate, the only one I every paid for. If you want to learn more on Linear Algebra I recommend the videos by [Three Blue One Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab). Three Blue One Brown uses powerfull visualisations — [his code for doing so is open source](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) — and this allows the viewer a better insight on how linear algebra works. His movies on [Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) have these interesting visualisations as well and are a nice addition to the lectures by Andrew Ng.

This is my current state. I am planning to apply the gained skills into some interesting blogposts. To deepen my knowledge I want to follow some more courses and I have started with deep probability. As I understand this is one of the thoughest courses at Stanford, but that seems to be the best motivation I can have:

- [Probabilistic Graphical Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-graphical-models).

### 4. Probabilistic programming

As a civil engineer you learn a lot of probability theory (altough limited to the probability of failure of a structure) and it makes sense to declare every variable using a probabilistic function instead of a deterministic value. I have only read on probabilistic programming and my knowledge is limited to Uber's [Pyro](https://github.com/uber/pyro).

I recently came across this [syllabus](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.10756.pdf) and will start my journey into probabilistic programming using this. I'll post about my learning on this blog.

### 5. Other topics

Other toptics that I find interesting but are not on the top of my list are the following, including courses:

- [Graph Analytics](https://people.csail.mit.edu/jshun/6886-s18/);
- [Mathematical Optimisation](https://www.coursera.org/learn/discrete-optimization).
