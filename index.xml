      <description>I plan to keep a list of the books I have read since past year.
2019 I have not finished any book yet, but I am reading the following:
 The Black Swan - Nassim Nicholas Taleb.  2018 Unfortunately this list is not as long as I thought it would be.
 Sapiens - Yuval Noah Hariri. I read this Book, just like everyone else. But unlike most people, I found it kind of hard to get through.</description>

      <description>I like to keep a list of useful resources on the web.
Who to follow I am no other social media platform than twitter, this is my main source of news (I am still in doubt whether to block the word &amp;ldquo;Trump&amp;rdquo;) and I keep up-to-date with tech related news. On twitter I highly recommend following:
 Ryan Hoover, the founder of Product Hunt and therefore ahead of everyone else when it comes to new start-ups, products or trends.</description>

      <description>Since I am trained as a (hydraulic) engineering I learned to code by myself. To prioritize my time I need a clear list of (prioritized) goals. The goal of publishing this list is similar as this website: Forcing myself to showcase my results and goals. If you have any questions or recommendations, please contact me on twitter.
This will be a &amp;ldquo;living&amp;rdquo; document and I&amp;rsquo;ll update is as I came across something else or finished one of the listed goals.</description>

      <description>My name is Joris den Uijl. I graduated as a hydraulic engineer from TU Delft in January &amp;lsquo;18. During my study I got more and more interested in &amp;ldquo;tech&amp;rdquo;. I started reading Hacker News, following ProductHunt and tought myself python programming. Luckily I was able to join a large marine contractor as a Data Engineer.
I like data science/analytics/visualisation and python so most of my projects will comprise either analysing data or obtaining data.</description>
