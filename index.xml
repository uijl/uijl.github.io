      <description>My name is Joris den Uijl. I graduated as a hydraulic engineer from TU Delft in January &amp;lsquo;18. During my study I got more and more interested in &amp;ldquo;tech&amp;rdquo;. I started reading Hacker News, following ProductHunt and taught myself python programming. After my graduation I worked one year as a quantitave consultant in finance. Luckily I got a call from my former graduation supervisor and was able to join a large marine contractor as a Data Engineer.</description>

      <title>Benefit of Scoring Right Before The Break</title>

      <description>I love watching football but there are several commentators in the Netherlands that have the annoying ability to kick in open doors and present useless facts. Unfortunately Dutch teams are often behind in international matches, so a statement that often returns is &amp;ldquo;If they score now, right before the break, they will start the second half with a morale boost&amp;rdquo;.
Although I understand the logic behind this reasoning, I have never seen data that substantiates it.</description>

      <description>Since I am trained as a (hydraulic) engineer I learned to code by myself. To prioritize my time I need a clear list of (prioritized) goals. The goal of publishing this list is similar as this website: Forcing myself to showcase my results and goals. If you have any questions or recommendations, please contact me on twitter.
This will be a &amp;ldquo;living&amp;rdquo; document and I&amp;rsquo;ll update this as I came across something else or finished one of the listed goals.</description>

      <description>I plan to keep a list of the books I have read since past year.
2019 I have not finished any book yet, but I am reading the following:
 The Black Swan - Nassim Nicholas Taleb. I find it hard to get through this book, but I enjoy the insights and the way of thinking that Taleb presents.  2018 Unfortunately this list is not as long as I hoped it would be.</description>

      <description>I like to keep a list of useful resources on the web.
Who to follow I am no other social media platform than twitter, this is my main source of news (I am still in doubt whether to block the word &amp;ldquo;Trump&amp;rdquo;) and I keep up-to-date with tech related news. On twitter I highly recommend following:
 Ryan Hoover, the founder of Product Hunt and therefore ahead of everyone else when it comes to new start-ups, products or trends.</description>
