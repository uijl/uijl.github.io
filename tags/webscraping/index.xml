      <description>I love watching football but there are several commentators in the Netherlands that have the annoying ability to kick in open doors and present useless facts. Unfortunately Dutch teams are often behind in international matches, so a statement that often returns is &amp;ldquo;If they score now, right before the break, they will start the second half with a morale boost&amp;rdquo;.
Although I understand the logic behind this reasoning, I have never seen data that substantiates it.</description>
