    <h1>Reading</h1>

    

    

<p>Below is a list of the books I have been reading, it is not as long as I would like it to be.</p>

<h3 id="2020">2020</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow"><strong>Thinking, Fast and Slow - Daniel Kahneman</strong></a> Very insightful.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36072.The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People"><strong>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People -  Stephen R. Covey</strong></a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2019">2019</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/106835.The_Intelligent_Investor"><strong>The Intelligent Investor - Benjamin Graham</strong></a> A great introduction into value investing. And a conclusion if you do not have the time to pick value stocks: invest in trackers and don&rsquo;t chicken out if there is a crash.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35167685-surely-you-re-joking-mr-feynman"><strong>&ldquo;Surely You&rsquo;re Joking, Mr. Feynman!&rdquo; -  Richard P. Feynman</strong></a> This book is amazing. Feyhnman takes you on a journey through his exceptional life.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/69571.Rich_Dad_Poor_Dad"><strong>Rich Dad, Poor Dad - Robert Kiyosaki</strong></a> On his podcast the author seems to be very arrogant, the book is similar. But there is some truth in what he is saying.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/82101.Richest_Man_in_Babylon_and_The_Magic_Story"><strong>The Richest man in Babylon - George Clason</strong></a> Both this book and Rich Dad, Poor Dad get recommended often if you want to learn more about becom financially independent, but I do not find it that insightfull. It basically comes down to three things: Do not spend more than you earn / have, Save at least 10% of income, Make your money work for you.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/242472.The_Black_Swan"><strong>The Black Swan - Nassim Nicholas Taleb</strong></a> I enjoy the insights and the way of thinking that Taleb presents.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2018">2018</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens"><strong>Sapiens - Yuval Noah Hariri</strong></a> I read this Book, just like everyone else. But unlike most people, I found it kind of hard to get through.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1301.Moneyball"><strong>Moneyball - Michael Lewis</strong></a> I like the books by Michael Lewis, I have read two books by him this year.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29780253-born-a-crime"><strong>Born a Crime - Trevor Noah</strong></a> Loved it.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7865083-liar-s-poker"><strong>Liar&rsquo;s Poker - Michael Lewis</strong></a> The second book of Michael Lewis that I read in 2018.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22237161-the-sellout"><strong>The Sellout - Paul Beatty</strong></a> I do not think that I understood it. It was very fun, and I love satire, but I feel like I missed something.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/128429.Against_the_Gods"><strong>Against the Gods - Peter Bernstein</strong></a> Interesting book on the definiting of risk and probability throughout the modern times.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32283133-origin"><strong>Origin - Dan Brown</strong></a> The only true novel I read this year. I always like to books by Dan Brown, with recurring patterns of symbolics and art history.</li>
